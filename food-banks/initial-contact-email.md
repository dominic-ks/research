Dear `Contact` / Hello,

I’m writing to you on behalf of `whatever we’re calling ourselves`. We’re a group of volunteer designers and software
developers, and we’re hoping to build free tools to help food banks to get the things they need.

As such, I’d love the opportunity to `meet with you/talk on the phone` to discuss what you need, how easy it is for you
to get it, and the advantages and shortcomings of the digital tools you currently use. I expect the `meeting/call to
last about 45 minutes, and we might discuss some emotional topics.

Everything we discuss is anonymous: I’ll take notes on what you say, but I won’t attach your name to your comments. If
you later decide you’d prefer us not to use your notes, you can always reply to this email (optional: or contact me on
`number`) and I’ll make sure they’re removed. I’ll share your comments with other volunteers in our group, but only for
the purpose of designing better tools.

If this sounds like something you’d like to participate in, please reply to this email (optional: or contact me on
`number`) and we’ll arrange a time. If you’d like to participate but can’t commit to a `meeting/call`, you can also take
part in our online survey at `link`.

Thanks very much for reading, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards,

`name`
